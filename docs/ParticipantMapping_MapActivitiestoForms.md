in this section, one would be required to map the Activity to its coresponding Form.

Activity will be associated with the selected form and the form chosen will be shown to the participant user throughout the process flow. Form associated should be relevant with the purpose of the process flow and tightly coupled such that it would be critical to determine the course of flow of the process flow.
