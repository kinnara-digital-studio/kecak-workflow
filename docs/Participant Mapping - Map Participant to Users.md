```
If the user mapped is inactive at the time of assignment is made, the particular user will not be assigned.
```

```
If there's no valid user found to be assigned to at the time of assignment is made,
the activity will be assigned to the current logged in user (previous performer).

#### Map to Org Chart ####

One may also map to a participant in relation to the reporting organization chart and the performers/participants in the process flow.

For example, we are trying to determine the participant that will be approving a claim. The person to approve a claim will be the HOD of the person that submitted the claim. Therefore, the setting would be "Performer's HOD where the performer executed Submit Claim"

#### Map to WorkFlow Variable ####

A participant can also be determined through the use of Workflow Variable. This is particularly useful when the participant is decided on-the-fly in the preceding activity with the value set into the Workflow Variable. If the variable value contains a username, then, the option to be set here would be "Username" with the correct Variable ID picked.
