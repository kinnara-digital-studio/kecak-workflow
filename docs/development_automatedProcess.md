# Automated Process

Before we make an application, the initial stage is to make the process as a reference.

Automated process is the stage where the manufacturing process is done in kecak. This automated process comes from a business process that has been designed and will be automated.

The following is an example of the stages of making a process from a simple business process.

An example of this simple process is the process of filing leave where the application will be approved by the HOD and Directors.
